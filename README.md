### Descripition.
<div style="text-align: justify">
In this project I was able to develop the front end of an online store with a shopping cart, using components such as React and Firebase as a server in the cloud. A friendly user experience was created, with instant visual updates, and scalable code. <br />

The online store is for an Argentinian timber furniture company which produces beautiful decoration objetcs made from wood-turned monopieces. We can also find leather made elements such as notebook cases, 'materos', bags, among others.

The store is organized in different sections:
- Cutting Boards.
- Home Deco.
- Leather.
- Side Tables.

The company is in a constant development of new products, which was taken into consideration during the design of the website to be able to make new adaptations in an efficient and simple way in the future.

### Dependencies
<div style="text-align: justify">

- **[React Router (v6.2.1)](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)** It facilitates the navigability and grants a dynamic routing to the application.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)** Allows you to include popular icons in your React projects easily, which utilizes ES6 imports that gives you the opportunity to only include the icons that your project is using.
- **[Firebase (v9.6.7)](https://firebase.google.com)** It is a service provided by Google to meet the different needs that an application and its development cycle may have, within which we find:
    - Security and authentication.
    - Storage and Query.
    - Hosting.
    - Monitoring.
    - Functions and more.
