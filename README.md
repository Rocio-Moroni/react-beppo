### Descripition.
:wave: In this project I was able to develop the front end of an online store with a shopping cart, using components such as React and Firebase as a server in the cloud. A friendly user experience was created, with instant visual updates, and scalable code.

The online store is for an Argentinian timber furniture company which produces beautiful decoration objetcs made from wood-turned monopieces. We can also find leather made elements such as notebook cases, 'materos', bags, among others.

The store is organized in different sections:
- Cutting Boards.
- Home Deco.
- Leather.
- Side Tables.

The company is in a constant development of new products, which was taken into consideration during the design of the website to be able to make new adaptations in an efficient and simple way in the future.

### Procedure to run the application locally.

1. We locate ourselves in the root folder `appbeppo`, open a new terminal and clone the repository with the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Rocio-Moroni/react-beppo.git`
2. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and include the provided environment variables inside.
3. From the terminal we locate ourselves in the root folder of the project and install all the dependencies with the command:
`npm install`
4. Finally, we run the app with the following command:
`npm start`

### Dependencies
- **[React Router (v6.2.1)](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6)** It facilitates the navigability and grants a dynamic routing to the application.
- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)** Allows you to include popular icons in your React projects easily, which utilizes ES6 imports that gives you the opportunity to only include the icons that your project is using.
- **[Firebase (v9.6.7)](https://firebase.google.com)** It is a service provided by Google to meet the different needs that an application and its development cycle may have, within which we find:
    - Security and authentication.
    - Storage and Query.
    - Hosting.
    - Monitoring.
    - Functions and more.

### Routes
















































# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
